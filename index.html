    <h1>Fashionista</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to the world of Fashion</h2>
    <p class="fashion">Whether you're in the mood for fashion tricks, outfit ideas, industry news, celebrity street
        style, or simply want to know the latest styles to shop.</p>

        <p class="fashion2">
            Fashion has the ability to change and shape lives through its personal connection to us all. We all have to
            wear clothes and every piece of clothing we buy represents a personal choice â€“ it is this intrinsically
            human relationship between us and our fashion that makes it political.

            A fashion statement is loosely defined as something original worn to make a bold statement about fashion knowledge or draw attention to oneself. Girls who started wearing pencil skirts in the 1950s were making a bold fashion statement in their clothing, as it differed widely from the accepted fashion trends.
